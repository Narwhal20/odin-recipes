    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>BBQ ribs are a quintessential comfort food that combines smoky, savory flavors with tender, fall-off-the-bone meat. Whether you're cooking for a summer cookout or a cozy family dinner, BBQ ribs are sure to please everyone at the table. This recipe focuses on creating ribs that are both flavorful and succulent, using a combination of a dry rub, slow cooking, and a tangy barbecue sauce.</p>
    <p>The preparation starts with a well-balanced dry rub that infuses the meat with a depth of flavor. The slow cooking process ensures the ribs are tender and juicy, allowing the connective tissues to break down perfectly. Finally, the ribs are slathered with a rich barbecue sauce and grilled to caramelize the sugars, giving them a beautiful, sticky glaze.</p>
